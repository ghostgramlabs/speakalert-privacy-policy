## Audio Playback

SpeakAlert plays reminder sounds using:

- Voice recordings created by the user  
- Text-to-speech (TTS)  
- System alarm tones (when enabled)  

All audio playback happens locally on the device.

For text-to-speech, reminder text may be processed by the device’s selected TTS engine provider according to your device settings.  

SpeakAlert does not transmit this data to any external servers.

- All reminder data and recordings remain on your device  
- Data is retained until you delete it or uninstall the app

## Third-Party / System Services

- Text-to-speech engine processing (based on system settings)  

These services are controlled by your device and operating system.

## Data Security
